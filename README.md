I'm a full-stack web and mobile developer. I focus on creating pratical, pleasant and playful apps and websites.

My journey in coding started by tinkering with HTML & CSS while managing newsletter and websites.

Now I've develed deep into JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native Expo, Next.js Node.js & PostgreSQL.

My interests are in mobile app development, and I'm learning Swift & SwitfUI.
